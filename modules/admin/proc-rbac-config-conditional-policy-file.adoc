= Configuring conditional policies defined in an external file

You can configure and manage conditional policies that are defined in an external file.

.Prerequisites
* You are logged in to your {ocp-short} account using the {ocp-short} web console.
* You have defined conditional policies in a YAML file, which includes role references, permission mappings, and conditions.

The following is an example of a YAML file defining conditional policies:

[source,yaml]
----
---
result: CONDITIONAL
roleEntityRef: 'role:default/test'
pluginId: catalog
resourceType: catalog-entity
permissionMapping:
  - read
  - update
conditions:
  rule: IS_ENTITY_OWNER
  resourceType: catalog-entity
  params:
    claims:
      - 'group:default/team-a'
      - 'group:default/team-b'
---
result: CONDITIONAL
roleEntityRef: 'role:default/test'
pluginId: catalog
resourceType: catalog-entity
permissionMapping:
  - delete
conditions:
  rule: IS_ENTITY_OWNER
  resourceType: catalog-entity
  params:
    claims:
      - 'group:default/team-a'
----

* You have defined roles and associated policies in a CSV file that serves as a basis for creating roles and permissions.

.Procedure

. In {ocp-short}, open `app-config.yaml` file and specify the path to both the `conditionalPoliciesFile` and the `policies-csv-file` as shown in the following example:
+
--
.Example `app-config.yaml` file
[source,yaml]
----
permission:
  enabled: true
  rbac:
    conditionalPoliciesFile: /some/path/conditional-policies.yaml
    policies-csv-file: /some/path/rbac-policy.csv
----
--

. To enable automatic reloading of the policy file without restarting the application, add the `policyFileReload` option and set it to `true`:
+
--
.Example `app-config.yaml` file 
[source,yaml]
----
permission:
  enabled: true
  rbac:
    conditionalPoliciesFile: /some/path/conditional-policies.yaml
    policies-csv-file: /some/path/rbac-policy.csv
    policyFileReload: true
----
--

. Optional: Define nested conditional policies in the YAML file as needed.
