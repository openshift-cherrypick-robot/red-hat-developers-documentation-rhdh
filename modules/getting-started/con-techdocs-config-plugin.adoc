= Configuring the TechDocs plugin

{product} includes a built-in TechDocs builder that can be used to generate static HTML documentation from your codebase. However, the default basic setup of the local builder is not intended for production.

You can use a CI/CD pipeline with the repository that has a dedicated job to generate docs for TechDocs. The generated static files are then stored in {odf-name} or in a cloud storage solution of your choice

After you configure OpenShift Data Foundation to store the files that TechDocs generates, you can configure the TechDocs plugin to use the {odf-name} for cloud storage.

In {product-short}, you can configure dynamic plugins using one of the following methods:

* The {product} Helm chart
* The {product} Operator
