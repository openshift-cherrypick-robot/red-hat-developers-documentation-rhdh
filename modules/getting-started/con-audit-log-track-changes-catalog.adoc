= Tracking changes in the {product-short} catalog database

In {product} {ocp-version-min} and later, changes to the catalog database are forwarded to a central log management system, such as ElasticSearch or Splunk by default. Tracking changes that add, remove, or update data in the catalog database informs administrators of user actions to help ensure accountability and transparency.
