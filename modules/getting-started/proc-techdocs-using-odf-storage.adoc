= Using {odf-name} for file storage

You can configure OpenShift Data Foundation to store the files that TechDocs generates using one of the following methods:

* The{odf-name} Helm chart
* The {odf-name} Operator

{odf-name} provides a `ObjectBucketClaim` custom resource (CR) that you can use to request an S3 compatible bucket backend. You must install the {odf-name} Operator to use this feature.
